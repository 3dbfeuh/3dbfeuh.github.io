ok now me personally im fine with the way furries work.

its just a bunch of people doing an animal cosplay which is fine.

pretty cool until you see the **real** side of the community.

its now an entire thing for pedophiles to target un-suspecting people wanting to be furries.

and then like *almost every* pedophile was like `"yoo let's gooooo people to harass"` which is why the furry community is garbage in my opinion.

basically, their community is now full of weirdos that are either future pedos or currently pedos.

my friend who is now a furry always wonders why when we game on garry's mod, i say "oh shit a furry, hunt him down!" like dude, im forced to interact with the extremely weird ones on a basis.

it doesnt matter if he's a rare normal one, it feels like a damn goofy ptsd gets triggered.

damn, i ranted. oh well no one is going to see this. (unless they want to)
